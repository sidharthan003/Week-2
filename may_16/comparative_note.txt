Comparative Note: Single-Agent vs Multi-Agent RAG

1. Overview
---------------
- Single-Agent RAG:
  * A single language model (LLM) handles both retrieval and generation.
  * Simplified pipeline: retrieve → augment context → generate.
 
- Multi-Agent RAG:
  * Multiple specialized agents collaborate (e.g., retriever agent, generator agent, planner agent).
  * Modular pipeline: planning → targeted retrieval → specialized generation → coordination.

2. Retrieval Process
----------------------
- Single-Agent:
  * Uses one retriever integrated with the LLM.
  * Retrieves broad, general context; may include noise.
  * Limited retrieval depth and query refinement.

- Multi-Agent:
  * Dedicated retriever agent(s) for different knowledge sources.
  * Can perform iterative, targeted retrieval based on planner prompts.
  * Supports dynamic query refinement and multi-source fusion.

3. Context Handling
----------------------
- Single-Agent:
  * All retrieved documents concatenated into one prompt.
  * Prone to context window limits and irrelevant information.

- Multi-Agent:
  * Planner agent selects and prioritizes contexts.
  * Generator agent receives curated snippets, ensuring relevance.
  * Better management of context window and hierarchical context assembly.

4. Generation Pipeline
------------------------
- Single-Agent:
  * LLM directly generates output from the augmented prompt.
  * Simpler, but may struggle with complex, multi-step tasks.

- Multi-Agent:
  * Planner defines tasks and sub-tasks.
  * Generator(s) specialize (e.g., summarizer, code writer, translator).
  * Conductor agent orchestrates final assembly of outputs.

5. Scalability & Performance
------------------------------
- Single-Agent:
  * Easier to scale horizontally by replicating the pipeline.
  * Limited by single-model throughput and context window.

- Multi-Agent:
  * Agents can be distributed, parallelized, and specialized.
  * Better throughput for complex tasks but higher orchestration overhead.

6. Complexity & Maintenance
-----------------------------
- Single-Agent:
  * Lower development and maintenance overhead.
  * Easier debugging and fewer components.

- Multi-Agent:
  * Increased system complexity and integration challenges.
  * Requires robust inter-agent communication and error handling.

7. Flexibility & Adaptability
--------------------------------
- Single-Agent:
  * Quick to deploy for simple Q&A and summarization.
  * Less flexible for workflows requiring diverse capabilities.

- Multi-Agent:
  * Highly adaptable to complex, domain-specific workflows.
  * Can integrate new agents for emerging tasks without overhauling core.

8. Use Cases
-------------
- Single-Agent Ideal For:
  * Simple document Q&A and chatbots.
  * Rapid prototyping and lightweight deployments.

- Multi-Agent Ideal For:
  * Complex pipelines (e.g., multi-lingual translation + analysis, code generation + testing).
  * Domain-specialized systems with modular requirements.
