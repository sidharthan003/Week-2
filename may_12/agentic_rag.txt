Agentic RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Agents) is an evolution of traditional RAG models that incorporates the concept of autonomous agents in the information retrieval and response generation process.

In classic RAG systems, a language model retrieves relevant context documents from a vector database and uses them to generate responses. While effective, this approach is mostly static and linear.

Agentic RAG introduces agentsâ€”autonomous, task-driven sub-processes that can reason, make decisions, and take iterative actions. These agents can plan multi-step strategies, refine queries based on intermediate outputs, and decide when to re-retrieve more data or ask clarifying questions.

The key advantage of Agentic RAG is its adaptability. Instead of relying on one-shot retrieval, agents can loop through processes like asking sub-questions, verifying facts, summarizing, or even delegating tasks to other agents.

This architecture enhances reliability and depth, especially in complex queries or research-heavy applications. Agentic RAG is more interactive, interpretable, and powerful in dynamic real-world use cases.

It is particularly useful in autonomous research assistants, customer support bots, or AI tools that require deep domain understanding.

In short, Agentic RAG merges LLMs, retrieval systems, and intelligent agents into a single powerful framework.
